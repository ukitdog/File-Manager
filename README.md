# File Manager
A small app to help file management written by electron js, currently supporting searching, bulk delete and rename. 
As a proof-of-concept / learning projects for Node.JS, Electron API (and packager), Plain Javascript and Semantic UI CSS Framework. 

Features:
1. Searching multiple file by a keyword. Have a option to search recursively
2. Bulk delete by keyword
3. Bulk rename (move) by keyword
4. Export search result to a text file (in csv format)
5. Contains keyboard shortcuts to search and delete. (Not for rename since we need to click for input anyway)

# To-Do
As my first Node / JS projects, there are many places to improve:
1. Better way to enter directory address, instead of manually like now
2. Better shortcuts system so we do not need to click anything
3. More file functionalities, basically :-)
